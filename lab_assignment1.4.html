    <h1>Difference Between &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; Tags</h1>

    <h2>Theory</h2>
    <p>
        In HTML, lists are used to display items in an organized manner.
        There are two commonly used list tags: ordered list and unordered list.
        The main difference between them is the way list items are displayed.
    </p>

    <h2>Ordered List (&lt;ol&gt;)</h2>
    <p>
        The &lt;ol&gt; tag is used to create an ordered list.
        In an ordered list, items are displayed in a specific sequence
        using numbers or letters.
    </p>

    <h3>Basic Structure of Ordered List</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Where Ordered List Is Used</h3>
    <p>
        Ordered lists are used when the order of items is important,
        such as steps in a procedure, instructions, or rankings.
    </p>

    <h2>Unordered List (&lt;ul&gt;)</h2>
    <p>
        The &lt;ul&gt; tag is used to create an unordered list.
        In an unordered list, items are displayed with bullet points
        and no specific order is followed.
    </p>

    <h3>Basic Structure of Unordered List</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Item one</li>
        <li>Item two</li>
        <li>Item three</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where Unordered List Is Used</h3>
    <p>
        Unordered lists are used when the order of items does not matter,
        such as shopping lists, features, or navigation menus.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The &lt;ol&gt; tag is used for ordered lists where sequence is important,
        while the &lt;ul&gt; tag is used for unordered lists where order is not important.
